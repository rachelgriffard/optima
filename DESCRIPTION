Description: The Tapestri platform offers DNA and protein analysis at the single cell level. Integrating both types of data is beneficial for studying multiple cell populations in heterogeneous microenvironments, such as cancer cells. We present optima, an R package for the processing and analysis of data generated from the Tapestri platform. This package provides streamlined functionality for raw data filtering, integration, normalization, transformation, and visualization. Insights gained from the optima package help users to identify unique cell populations and uncover surface protein expression patterns. The results generated by optima help researchers elucidate dynamic changes at the single cell level in heterogeneous microenvironments.
